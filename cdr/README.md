# Condenser cdr

Capture liquefaction transportation storage use. Issues of natural loss of gas to space, Hydrogen H and Helium He.

## Notes

* Hydrogen condenser first class. first order of priority. 'green' fuel.
* Helium production necessary for many other industrial purposes, for use in AGW dirigible project, 

Questions
* Helium not hybrid power applicable, (cold fusion issues aside), a distraction, consider elsewhere
* Is the only practical source of Helium only natural gas related? 
* After cryogenic distillation of Helium from natural gas what to do with Methane CH4 and other elements and molecules, inject back into Earth? 

## Status
TODO
* <todo: consider, condenser, H2 liquifaction, ... h gas network pipeline IO interface, feed in to network, longer term storage, consider as seperate project, with dependency on this els-h2o project, what are the limits on scale? how small/portable a unit might be produced, t-shirt sizing - XS S M L XL XXL - for different use cases, >
* <todo: consider, condenser for He liquifaction, what is the delta with H2 condenser liquifaction >
* <todo: consider, cryogenic distiller for He production, but how to deal with other elements like Methane from natural gas cryogenic distillation, ?, seperate project needed,  >

DONE
* <done: consider, intent to commit, >
