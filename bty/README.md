## Notes

Sand battery
* Sand battery, option for disrupted or destroyed infrastructure, disaster zone, conflict zone, refugee camps, . t-shirt sizing, SML, for different contexts. Resiliency, renewable green energy input, wind solar pv, green hydrogen, . Component modular system of system.
* A mature technology. Known solutions. Finland - and which other countries - already using them.
* Energy emergency crisis management. Distributed federated resiliency response to energy crises. Small scale stand alone hub and spoke. Not large scale single point of failure. Secondly link the small scale hubs for network effects. 
* In zones where components might be damaged due to locale specific conditions, that is in some scenarios, don't clump energy producing systems to avoid single point of generation failure. Built in redundancy where possible for energy storage unit.
* Distinguish between usage scenarios; normal BAU conditions,  emergency deployment,  refugee camp, disaster zone, conflict zone, . So different product development tracks for different deployment scenarios. However positive ratchet effect as different scenario options likely share many core component elements. 

## Status
TODO
* <todo: consider, first project, collate bill of materials, >
* <todo: consider, first small energy emergency crisis management product, deploy in field testing and evaluation, funding EU energy facility, hydrogen bank, UK funding partnership?, AU, CA, KR, JP, others, funding & expertise. Deploy first test PoC unit in a month? Possible with a dedicated team will and funding. Energy engineering activity. >

DONE
* <done: consider, intent to commit>
