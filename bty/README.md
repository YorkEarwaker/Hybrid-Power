# Battery bty

Chemical, aggregate 'sand', gravity, 

## Notes
Sand battery, option for disrupted or destroyed infrastructure, disaster zone, conflict zone, refugee camps, . t-shirt sizing, SML, for different contexts. Resiliency, renewable green energy input, wind solar pv, green hydrogen, . Component modular system of system.

A mature technology. Known solutions. Finland - and which other countries - already using them.

Energy emergency crisis management. Distributed federated resiliency response to energy crises. Small scale stand alone hub and spoke. Not large scale single point of failure. Secondly link the small scale hubs for network effects. 

## Status
TODO
* <todo: consider, first project, collate bill of materials, >
* <todo: consider, first small energy emergency crisis management product, deploy in field testing and evaluation, funding EU energy facility, hydrogen bank, UK funding partnership?, AU, CA, KR, JP, others, funding & expertise. Deploy first test PoC unit in a month? Possible with a dedicated team will and funding. Energy engineering activity. >
