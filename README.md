## Status

TODO
* <todo: consider, as commercial operation, second order of importance>
* <todo: consider, FOSS and FOSH approach for different scale solutions, t-shirting small medium large, open source creative commons, as with climate model \amn project>
* <todo: consider, start with small family unit capability, likely medium community 'village' north/south might have higher impact, large 'town' requires more top down, >
* <todo: consider, small family unit, getting people connected, information access, enabling to start small enterprises, enabling for energy self sufficiency, >
* <todo: consider, different context; small family unit urban poor global south, small family unit countryside poor global south, small family unit urban poor global north, small family unit countryside poor global north,  >
* <todo: consider, as part of climate model weather station related power system, large station unit and remote locales without reliable or with no mains electricity>
* <todo: consider, smaller units for supply to homes or communities, distributed federted power generation help in resillency, >

DONE
* <done: intent to commit>
