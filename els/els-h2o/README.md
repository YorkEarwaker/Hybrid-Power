## Notes

Principle
* H100 100% Hydrogen, that is not blended with natural gas, 

Safety, 
* Regulatory framework, UK, other jurisdictions, 

Use Cases - hydrogen ready appliances
* Cooking, hobs, ovens
* Heating, boilers
* other? 

## Status
TODO
* <todo: consider, higher level project hydrogen hot water boiler, home heating, >
* <todo: consider, hydrogen transportation, liquid hydorgen container, gas pipeline, other, >
* <todo: consider, hydrogen storage, lh container, gas container, other, >
* <todo: consider, hydrogen production as close to source use as possible, when is that practical and safe and when not, >
* <todo: consider, just in time, jit hydrogen production in product that uses it, workable? separate stadards based els-h2o compoenents, make jit h component, use jit h coponent say boiler, >
* <todo: consider, edge production different from jit production, much like solar PV for small scale use, safty an issue here, also with hybrid power units could be converted to electricity at the edge for immediate use or sold to the network,  >

DONE
* <done: consider, intent to commit, >
